Step 1: Project Planning
Before diving into code, it's helpful to outline what you want your program to do. Based on what you’ve mentioned, here’s a rough breakdown:

Core Features:
User Registration and Authentication:

Allow users to register and log in to track their media consumption.
Media Consumption Logging:

Track movies, books, and music with details such as:
Title
Genre
Rating
Date watched/read/listened
User review
Additional details (e.g., author for books, director for movies)
History and Planning (Diary):

Users can see a history of their logged media.
Users can plan future consumption and add media to their "To-Do" list.
Statistics and Analytics:

Generate statistics based on the user’s consumption:
Number of books, movies, music consumed by genre, author, country, year, etc.
Recommendations:

Provide recommendations based on the user’s history (e.g., suggest movies/books/music of a similar genre or from the same author/director).
Reviews:

Users can write reviews for each media type they’ve consumed and share them with others.
